The objective of this distributed systems lab is to analyse the security of LoRaWAN. LoRaWAN is a long range, low bandwidth wireless area network standard commonly used for IoT devices. While LoRaWAN has been released in June 2015, the use of LoRaWAN is still in its early days and not much security-related research is available.

While the initial focus of the project was on general security-related aspects, the focus changed during the project to analyse the security of event-based IoT devices using LoRaWAN.
